        <h3> A. Ligand based AI models</h3>

        <p>We have tried different training sets containing different virus species and their targets to build target specific or phenotype based classification AI models using GHDDI self-developed HAG-Net deep learning system.
            HAG-Net, short for Heterogeneous Aggregation Graph Net, constructs multi-channel convolution with hybrid aggregation to enhance the feature extraction capability for graph-based molecular data.
            We only selected models showing 5-fold cross-validation AUC>0.9 as qualification for further predictive practice, and the results are ensemble predictions. Viral targets, including RDRP, Helicase, 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 showing relatively higher between species conservation are prioritized in this effort.
            We use these models to predict different bioactivities of approved or investigational stage drug molecules (~12K) in GHDDI stock as part of the drug repurposing effort. As we are constantly improving our algorithm and expanding our training data, the results will be updated periodically.
