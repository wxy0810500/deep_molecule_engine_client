    <p class="doc">GHDDI Internal Infectious Disease Service is open internal to GHDDIers. This service will continuously open the AI models involving global health, e.g. mtb and malaria.</p>
    <p class="doc"> Currently, 3 models are online including TB18K_10uM, TB13K_1uM and Malaria16K_nochiral. Details about their training sets and 5-fold cross validation performance are illustrated below.
        Other version of AI models for mtb and malaria will be updated and maintained regularly.

    <p class="doc">TB18K_10uM: The training set is obtained from Thomas’s work published in 2018 [1]. 10uM is used as cutoff for mtb activity.</p>
    <p class="doc">TB13K_1uM: *This training set is prepared using <=1uM as positive and >10uM as negative. As the mtb phenotype activity has initial assay error range, data from 1uM to 10uM is removed from the training set, which improves the performance.</p>
    <p class="doc">Malaria16K_nochiral: Malaria training set is downloaded from http://portals.broadinstitute.org/mtrp/[2]. Chiral centers are further processed and merged. If one of the isomers is active, the compound is labeled as active.</p>
    <p class="doc">The AI models were constructed using the most-up-to-date GHDDI’s internal HAG-Net method [3] with the best performance algorithm version 4v4 set with cfg2 hyper-parameter configuration. AuPR is the area under the precision and recall curve, which balances both measurements. Thus, AuPR is calculated to measure the AI model performance during 5-fold cross validation and used as the measurement to choose the best models in this service.</p>
